			<h4 class="subtitle">Methodology</h4>
			<p>The observation was made using the POEMS framework to observe how people interacted with technology, each other, and with the different services offered by the library.</p>

			<h4 class="subtitle">Observations</h4>
			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">People</h6>
				<p>
					All ages and equally males and females.
					<ul>
						<li>Babies and children: accompanied by their parents and even grandparents. They were reading or playing games (board games and computer games).</li>
						<li>Teenagers: young ones were playing in the computers, older teens (16-18) were doing homework.</li>
						<li>Young adults: alone or in small groups, studying with computers or reading.</li>
						<li>Adults: in pairs or alone. Some larger groups gathered in meeting rooms to work together. Usually reading, on the computer or touring the library. Parents were with their children, reading to them or doing other stuff while their children read.</li>
					</ul>
					Different languages were spoken. Some advertisements and signs were both in English and in Spanish. There were also whole sections of books in Spanish.
					People were reading books, using computers for work and recreationally while others were just walking around touring the library.
					Each floor had an information desk, and employees were nice and willing to help.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Objects</h6>
				<p>
					People were interacting with books, computers, tablets, and board games. Some people had their own laptops, some others used the computers in the computer stations, and some others rented laptops from the library to use. Some people had coffee or water bottles beside them. There were some technological devices like 3D printers and gaming computers. Computers were also available exclusively to search for books inside the library.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Environments</h6>
				<p>
					The architecture is very modern and new. There is a lot of natural light since there’s windows everywhere. One of the sides has a nice view to the lake. The library had warm-white light (it felt warm but still allowed for concentration). There’s a huge art piece on one of the atrium’s walls that resembles a cuckoo clock with a pendulum.
					In each section:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Children’s section: loud, colorful walls, funky furniture. This section had computers that were being used by children to play games.</li>
					<li>Teenagers: colorful, not as loud as the children’s section but not silent. DVD’s and audio books were available. This section had computers that were being used for homework, as well as a gaming computer station that was being used by all boys and 1 girl. This section is targeted to teens between 13-18. There were voter registration applications available for teens who were about to turn 18.</li>
					<li>Books/studying sections: quiet, modest furniture. Adults working, reading, or browsing the web.</li>
					<li>Living room: chill section, furniture was more relaxed and comfortable, darker. There weren’t so many people working here, but instead they were reading or using their phone.</li>
					<li>Rooftop garden: the weather was cold so not many people were outside. It had natural light and cozy furniture. What makes this section unique is that there’s a lot of plants and a great view of the city.</li>
					<li>Atrium: lots of people passing by and using the stairs, loud, tall ceiling.</li>
				</ul>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Messages</h6>
				<p>
					Parents were accompanying children. Teenagers were reading by themselves while parents worked. Some parents were reading to their children or playing with them. Adults were working by themselves or in pairs. Those who were reading were usually alone. Private rooms had groups of 4-8 people in meetings.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Services</h6>
				<p>
					No music was playing in the background. The teenagers section had TV’s which displayed advertisement regarding events, useful information or services offered by the library. Some examples of things displayed were: First Job Tips (how to prepare for interviews), and tutors available for help with certain subjects. There’s also signs around the library with this month’s calendar.
					In the library people can read, rent books, use computers, use the technology petting zoo with different devices, rent computers, eat, play chess, talk.

				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Expected observation</h6>
				<p>
					I was expecting to see books and I did see lots of them about every topic I can imagine. Something unexpected is that besides books, the library also has laptops and tablets you can rent, and other technical devices like 3D printers.
				</p>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Interesting observation</h6>
				<p>
					The library is a very diverse place. There were people from all ethnicities, ages, and economic statuses. Nobody looked uncomfortable or as an outsider. I think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that there’s something available for everyone: from books of all genres and topics, to CD’s, Zines, Manga, and technology, and its comfortable and warm design. The library makes everyone feel welcome no matter their background, and I think it’s uncommon to find this on a government-owned building.
